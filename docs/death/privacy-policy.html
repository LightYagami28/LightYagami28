        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the Privacy Policy for <strong>Death Bot</strong>, a bot operating on Discord. This policy outlines the way we collect, use, and protect your data when you interact with the bot. By using Death Bot, you consent to the collection and use of your data as described below.</p>

        <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Discord Data:</strong> Death Bot may collect and store information that is available via the Discord API, including your Discord user ID, username, and the server you are using the bot in (Discord guild).</li>
            <li><strong>Message Data:</strong> Death Bot may log messages you send in servers where it is active, including commands issued to the bot and other interactions within the bot’s scope. These logs are used to process your requests and improve the bot’s functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>No Personal Data:</strong> We do not actively collect any personally identifiable information unless explicitly stated. Death Bot does not ask for sensitive data such as email addresses, phone numbers, or addresses unless specifically required by the bot's functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics Data:</strong> We may collect non-personal data about how the bot is used, such as the frequency of commands and interactions. This information is used to optimize the bot’s performance and improve the user experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. How We Use Your Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bot Functionality:</strong> The data is used to enable the features and functionality of Death Bot, such as processing commands and responding to interactions. We use your Discord user ID and server information to provide a personalized experience within the bot.</li>
            <li><strong>Bot Improvement:</strong> The information we collect is used to analyze and improve the performance of Death Bot. This helps us identify bugs, optimize features, and make improvements for a better user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Bot Security:</strong> The data helps ensure that the bot is functioning securely and reliably, and to prevent misuse or malicious activity within the Discord server.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Data Retention</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Retention Period:</strong> We retain data only for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the bot's purpose. This includes keeping logs of user interactions while the bot is active. Once no longer needed, this data is deleted.</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion Requests:</strong> If you would like to request the deletion of any data associated with your Discord account, please contact us at <a href="mailto:Alessandro824@proton.me" class="link">Alessandro824@proton.me</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Data Sharing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Sharing:</strong> We do not share your personal data with any third parties. However, we may share non-personally identifiable data (such as usage statistics) with trusted partners or services to improve the functionality of the bot. This will not include any personal information or Discord-specific data.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> In some circumstances, we may be required to disclose data if mandated by law or to protect the rights and safety of the bot’s users and developers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Data Security</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Security Measures:</strong> We implement reasonable security practices to protect the data we collect. This includes encrypting sensitive data and limiting access to it based on role and need.</li>
            <li><strong>No Guarantee:</strong> Although we take precautions to protect your data, no security system is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee the security of the data you share with us.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes, we will update the "last modified" date at the bottom of this page. By continuing to use Death Bot after these changes, you accept the updated Privacy Policy.</li>
            <li>If you do not agree with the updated Privacy Policy, you should stop using Death Bot immediately.</li>
